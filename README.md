# Message_Encoder
An encryption and decryption software program to encrypt and decrypt messages with the Caesar and Vig√®nere method, made by SLZR for a school project (you can find the subject in the file called "SUJET.pdf")

# Explanatory notes
This system works only with Python (go to Message_Encoder.py to see exactly how it works). You can encrypt any sort of message or text with it and you will also be able to decrypt them (only for Ceasar Method, the decryption of Vigenere is comming quickly). 

# Different functions
First, the text that the user enters is formated with some functions that remove spaces, accents and capitalize it. Then the user can enter a key. 

# Ceasar
For Caesar's method, the text or message will be shifted in the alphabet by the number of the key that the user entered before.
Then, for the decryption we use a simple brutforce method.

# Vigenere
For Vigenere's method, the system is the same: it works also with a key. The key is in the form of a word or a sentence. In order to encrypt our text, for each character we use a letter of the key to perform the substitution. Obviously, the longer and more varied the key, the better the text will be encrypted.
(Vigenere decryption is coming)

# Displaying
For the software display, I used a famous python library called "Tkinter", here is the documentation that explain who this library works:(https://docs.python.org/fr/3/library/tk.html)

# ZIP file
The  software is available in ".exe" format in the zipped file called "Message_Encoder.zip". To make it executable, I used a software called "auto-py-to-exe", you can find and download this software here:
